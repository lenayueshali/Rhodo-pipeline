# Rhodo-pipeline
DTW code for alignment of rhodolith fruticose thalli geochemical transects. A new workflow is introduced that integrates vital stain calibration, microCT-based semi-automated increment width detection and dynamic time warping to assemble a discrete chronology (March — July, over 133 days) using multiple fruticose thalli.
